It's interesting how we perceive the world and make decisions in the world, even in the presence of evidence that something is bad.

TDD

Static vs Dynamic

I read it, and I still wouldn't give up static typing... why?

I'm not sure; it feels safer, it feels like... but only for 1% improvement, is it worth it?

Logic vs. Real World.

Is it really 1% improvement and we are doing stupid things?
Or is the research flawed, and then why there isn't better research in this 1B$ industry.

We are not making decisions like engineers, but rather like consumers... we feel giddy when we try out something new, we feel safer when we use static language or TDD and hence we use those; rather than.
