I'm Egon, a software engineer from Tartu, Estonia. I'm highly interested in understanding foundational principle of software development and been investigating it for 10 years informally. I strongly believe that there are many aspects missing in software development practice today.

On my free time I like to [play around with music](https://soundcloud.com/egon-elbre/), [draw](https://gallery.egonelbre.com/) and dance.
