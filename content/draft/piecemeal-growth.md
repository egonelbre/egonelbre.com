Creating complex systems is difficult, if not impossible. Complex systems must be grown. There are many subtleties in how things interact, things that you forgot.  
Iteratively build up the system rather than designing everything upfront. Such systems will be more tolerant to change, because they were built by iterative change.

  

In the Oregon Experiment \[Brand 1994\]\[Alexander 1988\] [Alexander](http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/ca/ca/ca.html) noted:

_Large-lump development is based on the idea of_ **_replacement_**_. Piecemeal Growth is based on the idea of_ **_repair_**_.  ... Large-lump development is based on the fallacy that it is possible to build perfect buildings. Piecemeal growth is based on the healthier and more realistic view that mistakes are inevitable.  ... Unless money is available for repairing these mistakes, every building, once built, is condemned to be, to some extent unworkable.  ... Piecemeal growth is based on the assumption that adaptation between buildings and their users is necessarily a slow and continuous business which cannot, under any circumstances, be achieve in a single leap._
