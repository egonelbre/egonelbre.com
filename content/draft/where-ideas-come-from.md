My opinion with regards to where ideas come from. It does seem to be learnable.

There are also different methodologies for coming up with ideas such as SCAMPER, TRIZ... But, all of them roughly seem to boil down to a few skills.

## Collecting ideas

* First skill: collecting (writing down) and memorizing a significant amount of ideas. In music it would be melodies, harmonies, chords, voicings, forms, sounds... in stories it would be characters, story/character archetypes, settings, people, motivations, places, psychology, words... in painting it could be brush technique, color combinations, composition, distortions... This is all about learning the vocabulary of an artform.

Collecting ideas should also include from unrelated places. e.g. seeing a tree in the wind and rain; and thinking how that would translate to music.

**TODO** curiosity, open minded

## Transforming ideas

* Second skill: transforming these ideas, with substituting, combining, adjusting, adding, removing.

Different artforms have their own set of specific transformations; for example modal transformation in music. There also seem to be general transformations that can be applied in all contexts; for example Christopher Alexanders "Fifteen Properties in Nature".

An interesting approach to practicing different transformations is using things like "Oblique strategies" cards. An other way to learn this skill is by imposing constraints. Constraints require you to transform your existing ideas to fit a specific box.

**TODO** random association

Practicing this skill is about finding fluency in manipulating ideas collected by first skill.

If you haven't collected ideas, then you won't have vocabulary to say much... if you haven't learned transforming ideas, then you end up repeating what others have said.

## Understanding impact

* Third skill: recognizing what resonates with you, other people and the world.

This is about learning how to recognize that the art is having an impact on people, how it impacts them and how it changes them. It's mostly about learning your own emotions and how different "collected ideas" change those emotions.

One way to learn it is to try and express a specific emotion and doing it as strongly as possible; using an emotion wheel as a list. Second is trying to understand how different things resonate with you; for example using Mirror of Self test.

Without this skill the result can be beautiful and novel; however without clear feeling and impact. At this moment AI art seems to be lacking this part, but it's pretty good with the first and second skills.

**TODO** Science vs art. Impact dimensions, e.g. mechanical or psychological.

## Freedom in experimentation

* Fourth skill: freedom to be bad and wrong.

This is less about learning a new skill and more about unlearning "need to be right" mentality. Criticising yourself while coming up with ideas seems to stop the flow of ideas. Many good ideas are a result of combining/transforming multiple bad ideas. If you stop the bad ideas from forming, then they can never grow up to be good ideas.

**TODO** rather than no, embrace "yes and".

**TODO** stress.

## Polishing an idea

**TODO** is this a fundamental skill?

Eliminate unnecessary.

## Conclusion

There could be a few more skills that I've yet to identify, but these do seem a necessity for fluently coming up with new ideas. These skills need to be practiced to the point where you don't need to think about them consciously.
