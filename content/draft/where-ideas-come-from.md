I recently had a few discussions about creativity, and a question kept coming up: "Where do ideas come from?" For instance, how do you come up with melodies, or how do you generate ideas during a game jam? It might seem like something you're born with or not. After some thought, I reached the conclusion that it's a learnable skill.

Let's break down the skills into manageable sub-skills:

- **Idea Collection:** Gathering ideas effectively.
- **Idea Analysis:** Inspecting and organising ideas.
- **Idea Transformation:** Modify one idea to another one.
- **Context Understanding:** Understanding the bigger picture and being able to articulate problems.
- **Impact Understanding:** Analysing and intuitiing the effect of ideas.
- **Idea Polishing:** Refining and enhancing ideas to achieve their full potential.
- **Experimentation Freedom:** Embracing experimentation and exploration instead of critique.

I'm not entirely sure if this is the complete list, but it should serve as an excellent starting point.

## Idea Collection

The first step in mastering any art form or subject is to collect ideas. This will create a "vocabulary" of concepts that you can manipulate in your mind to generate new ideas.

For instance:

- In **music**, you might collect melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, voicings, song forms, instrument sounds, and composer styles.
- In **storytelling**, you might collect characters, story archetypes, settings, people, motivations, places, words, and more
- In **painting**, you might collect brush techniques, colour combinations, compositional ideas, different mediums, styles, perspective approaches, and art movements.
- In **programming**, you might collect architecture ideas, programming patterns, algorithms, naming conventions, libraries, common mistakes, and various ways of coding the same problem.
- In **dance**, you might collect different folk dances, movements, interpretations, and synchronisation with musical elements.

Figure out what categories of ideas can be collected in your specific subject. Some categories are really concrete things, some are abstract, some are processes, some are weird. They all serve as a source of inspiration and sources for transformations.

### How do we collect?

There are several methods to gather ideas:

- Recreating something, which is essentially imitation.
- Memorising information.
- Writing down ideas in a notebook.
- Recording voice notes.
- Taking photographs or videos of something.
- Copy-pasting information from the internet.

Roughly speaking, the more effort you invest in processing and collecting an idea, the more accessible it becomes for future use.

An important note is that you don't necessarily have to be literal when collecting ideas. You can also try to collect from unrelated subjects. For instance, you might see a leaf blowing in the wind on a tree and try to interpret it based on the subject you're trying to be creative at. You might wonder which instruments would be suitable for representing this leaf musically and how it would sound. Or, you could interpret that same leaf as a dance.

One common mistake while collecting ideas is to set the quality bar too high for the ideas you collect. If you don't collect bad ideas, they never get a chance to develop into good ones. Similarly, an idea might be terrible in one context but brilliant in another. Of course, don't waste more than 3 minutes writing down a bad idea; just jot down a few words.

Be curious and open-minded about ideas, even if you don't feel a strong connection to them.

### Random ideas

One source of inspiration can be randomness. While the quality of randomness is often poor, it can help you step outside your usual range of ideas. The key is to allow yourself to be inspired by these random ideas or transform them into something constrained.

Here are a few variations on randomness:

- **Randomness from a strict set:** For instance, you have a deck of cards, each with a unique word, and you draw three cards to form your song title.
- **Randomness from nature:** For example, you use raindrop sounds as your rhythm.
- **Randomness from playing:** For instance, you put mittens on your hands and attempt to play something on the piano.

I'm sure there are many more ways to incorporate these.

### Ideas from our own thoughts

One of the growing challenges is the incessant environmental noise. Distractions from social media, news, traffic, and notifications can drown out our own thoughts, making it difficult to clear our minds and hear our ideas. In some cases, it can take hours of silence for our thoughts to become sufficiently clear.

Therefore, it's important to practice being present with your own thoughts without distractions or external sounds.

### Getting Started

#### Exercise 1. Collect Categories

Write down 20 categories of ideas you can collect.

By having a list of categories of ideas you can collect makes it easier to notice them. Similarly, it helps to broaden your idea collection.

Every time you encounter or think of a new category, write it down.

#### Exercise 2. Collect Ideas

Gather 20 ideas, every day for a month straight.

This exercise cultivates the habit and skill of noticing ideas. Many people walk around, in a sense, blindfolded to the countless ideas that surround them. While the primary objective isn't to accumulate these 600 ideas; they will still be beneficial in the subsequent exercises.

Remember, the purpose of this exercise is to practice collecting ideas, not necessarily collecting the best ones. Let the world serve as an inspiration.

## Idea Analysis

Once we've collected a bunch of ideas, we should try to analyse and organise them. This process helps us gain deeper insights and a clearer understanding of them.

Analysis is the process of breaking down an idea into manageable parts that are easier to comprehend. Although the term "parts" may not be suitable in all contexts, the underlying principle is to avoid looking at the whole idea at the same time. Let's consider a few different approaches to this:

- **Divide into parts:** divide the idea into subideas.
- **Examine aspects:** pay attention to only a single attribute or property of the idea.
- **Change the environment:** look at the idea in another situation.
- **Change the perspective:** look at the idea from another persons perspective.

Dividing something into parts is the easiest to understand. Discard some part of the idea and then look at it in isolation. For example, if you have a song to analyse you first look at the introduction, then the verse, then the chorus. In painting you might focus on how part of the painting was done. In programming, you might focus at a subdomain rather than trying to understand the whole application.

Examining aspects involves analysing a specific property or attribute. For instance, in music, you can examine harmonic progression, dynamics, rhythmic density, instrumentation density, or pitch. In painting, you might focus on brush technique, colour usage, composition, theme, storytelling, or eye guidance. In programming, you could concentrate on performance, memory usage, code readability, or usability. There is definitely an overlap with the previously mentioned idea categories.

Changing the environment is about understanding how an idea changes based on what surrounds it. For example, in music, a song will sound widely different in church acoustics compared to car acoustics. A painting will look different in dark compared to a well lit room. A program will feel and behave differently when used from a computer or a mobile phone.

Changing perspectives involves comprehending how diverse individuals perceive ideas. For instance, death metal might be noise to some people while providing comfort to others. Individuals with colour blindness perceive paintings differently. Similarly, highly technical professionals and casual software users employ software in vastly different ways.

Overall, analysis provides a way to understand which elements of an idea can be changed. It also makes the understanding of ideas more detailed.

### Idea Organization

Another way to gain insight is organization. While analysis provides more concrete understanding of an idea, organisation provides a general understanding about a collection of ideas. Organising as the process also helps to repeat and re-examine the gathered ideas.

Organising ideas can be done in a few ways:

- **Reviewing ideas:** looking over the ideas as a collection.
- **Adding labels:** adding labels based on either idea categories or aspects.
- **Consolidate similar ideas:** grouping and writing similar ideas together.
- **Contrasting ideas:** comparing ideas based on different aspects.

Eventually this organising, finding similarities and differences helps us create intuition and "best practices". This in turn will make our ability to process, remember and understand ideas easier.

## Transforming ideas

The next skill you should master is transforming and manipulating ideas. The more skilled you are with regard to modifying the ideas in your head, the faster you can iterate on new approaches.

There are quite a few frameworks that teach you how to transform ideas. For example, [SCAMPER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCAMPER) describes a few transformations:

* Substitute - What if I replace one part of an idea with another?
* Combine - What if I combine two things into a single thing?
* Adapt - What are other ideas that would fit into my problem?
* Modify, magnify, minify - What if I change the meaning, color, sound, etc., of an idea?
* Put to another use - What are other ways this idea can be used?
* Eliminate - What if I remove some element of an idea?
* Reverse - What if I change the relationship or order between the parts?

They are effectively directed questions that transform one idea to another -- hence the name "transformation". Such transformations are the building blocks of ideation.

**TODO** Take an existing idea and improve upon it.

Of course, specific art forms and science disciplines may have their own transformations. For example, in technical systems, [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) technique can be used. In music, you can have things like "modal transformation". In art, you might try to imagine what if an artwork was done in a different style.

### Oblique strategies

https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html

An interesting approach to practicing different transformations is using things like "Oblique Strategies" cards. Another way to learn this skill is by imposing constraints. Constraints require you to transform your existing ideas to fit a specific box.

Many interpretations.

Abstract and absurd questions.

### Constraints

Setting limitations on the ideas can foster creativity because you have less choice, but also you cannot use your usual strategies.

### Develop Transformations



### Summary

Overall, mastering transformations is about two things:

* Finding and building a knowledge of as many transformations as possible
* Practicing the transformations so you become fluent in them

### So, how do you get started?

Collect a list of 50 transformations for your domain. You don't need to do it in one day, but aim for a significant number. Over time, you can add as you encounter them.

Practice one or more transformations on a few ideas that you have collected.

Remember, it's an exploration and practice - most of the new ideas you come up with are going to be terrible, and that's fine.

## Understanding impact

* Third skill: recognizing what resonates with you, other people, and the world.

This is about learning how to recognize that the art is having an impact on people, how it impacts them, and how it changes them. It's mostly about learning your own emotions and how different "collected ideas" change those emotions.

Effect on people vs. resonating with myself.

Ego removal

One way to learn it is to try and express a specific emotion and doing it as strongly as possible; using an emotion wheel as a list. The second is trying to understand how different things resonate with you; for example, using the Mirror of Self test.

Without this skill, the result can be beautiful and novel; however, it lacks clear feeling and impact. At this moment, AI art seems to be lacking this part, but it's pretty good with the first and second skills.

**TODO** Science vs. art. Impact dimensions, e.g. mechanical or psychological.

## Freedom in experimentation

* Fourth skill: freedom to be bad and wrong.

This is less about learning a new skill and more about unlearning the "need to be right" mentality. Criticising yourself while coming up with ideas seems to stop the flow of ideas. Many good ideas are a result of combining/transforming multiple bad ideas. If you stop the bad ideas from forming, then they can never grow up to be good ideas.

**TODO** Rather than no, embrace "yes and".

**TODO** Stress.

## Polishing an idea

**TODO** Is this a fundamental skill?

Eliminate unnecessary.

Kill your darlings.

Emotional resonance.

## Getting things done

Flow

Habits

## What if missing

If you haven't collected ideas, then you won't have a vocabulary to say much... if you haven't learned transforming ideas, then you end up repeating what others have said.


## Conclusion

There could be a few more skills that I've yet to identify, but these do seem a necessity for fluently coming up with new ideas. These skills need to be practiced to the point where you don't need to think about them consciously.
