I recently had few discussions around creativity and a question seemed to pop up "Where do ideas come from?". For example how do you come up with melodies, or how do you come up with ideas in a game jam. It might seem like something that you are born with or not. After thinking about it, I came to a conclusion that it should be a learnable skill.

Let's jump right to it and break it down. I've come with few sub-skills that should be mastered:

1. Collecting and organizing ideas
2. Transforming ideas
3. Understanding impact
4. Freedom in experimentation
5. Polishing an idea

I'm not certain this is the full list; but it should be a great starting point.

## Collecting ideas

First thing that needs mastering is collecting ideas. This will create a "vocabulary" of things we can manipulate in our head to create new ideas.

In music you might collect melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, voicings, song forms, instrument sounds, composers. In story-telling you might collect characters, story/character archetypes, settings, people, motivations, places, words. In painting you might collect brush technique, color combinations, compositional ideas, different mediums, styles, perspective approaches, art movements. In programming you might collect architecture ideas, programming patterns, algorithms, ÃŸnaming of things, libraries, different ways of writing the same thing, methodologies of modeling. In dance it could be different folk dances, movements, interpretation, syncing to musical elements.

You should try to figure out what kinds of things can be collected in your specific subject.

Every artform and science will have many things you can collect; at different sizes and different levels of abstraction. They will all serve as a source of inspiration and a small nugget of information that can transform into something else.

**How do we collect?**

* Recreating something
* Memorization
* Writing down in a notebook
* Recording a voice note
* Taking a video or picture of something
* Copy-paste from the internet

Roughly speaking, the more effort you put into processing and collecting an idea, the more readily available it is for later.

An important note is that you don't necessarily have to be literal in collecting ideas, but also try to collect from unrelated subjects. For example, you might see a leaf blowing in the wind on a tree; then try to interpret based on the subject you are trying to be creative at. You might wonder which instruments would suit representing this leaf musically and how would it sound. Or how would you interpret that same leaf as a dance.

One common mistake while trying to collect ideas, is to set the quality bar too high for ideas that you collect. If you don't collect bad ideas, they never get a chance to grow up a good idea. Similarly, a idea in one context might be horrible, but brilliant in another. Of course, don't spend over 3mins to write down a bad idea, just write a few words on it.

Be curious and open minded about ideas, even if you don't feel a connection.

How do you start this process?

I would recommend starting to collect 20 ideas per day for a month straight. This will get your brain into the habit of seeing, noticing and writing down ideas all the time. The important part isn't really the 600 ideas that you collect, however they are helpful; it's more about noticing interesting ideas in the world.

### Organizing ideas

Once you have collected ideas you should also try to organize them. This helps your brain build abstractions and find similarities between the ideas.

**How do we organize?**

* Review
* Consolidate similar ideas
* Expand and elaborate
* Tagging with labels

By creating systems and similarities we end up with a better understanding of the collected ideas. Interestingly, organizing will also make collecting new ideas easier, because it takes less effort to remember and understand them.
Eventually this organization and analysis of existing ideas can give rise to insight into best practices or intution how different ideas fit together.

## Transforming ideas

The next skill you should master is transforming and manipulating ideas. The more skilled you are withregards to modifying the ideas in your head, the faster you can iterate on new approaches.

There are quite a few frameworks that teach you how to transform ideas, for example [SCAMPER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCAMPER) approach describes a few transformations:

* Substitute - What if I replace one part of an idea with another?
* Combine - What if I combine two things into a single thing?
* Adapt - What are other ideas that would fit into my problem?
* Modify, magnify, minify - What if I change the meaning, color, sound etc. of an idea?
* Put to another use - What are other ways this idea can be used?
* Eliminate - What if I remove some element of an idea?
* Reverse - What if I change the relationship or order between the parts?

They are effectively directed questions that transform one idea to another -- hence the name "transformation". Such transformations are the building blocks of ideation.

Of course, specific artforms and science disciplines may have their own transformation. For example in technical systems [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) technique can be used. In music you can have things like "modal transformation". In art you might try to imagine what if an artwork was done in a different style.

### Oblique strategies

An interesting approach to practicing different transformations is using things like "Oblique strategies" cards. An other way to learn this skill is by imposing constraints. Constraints require you to transform your existing ideas to fit a specific box.

### Constraints

Setting limitations to the ideas can foster creativity, because you have less choice, but also you cannot use your usual strategies.

### Summary

Overall mastering transformations is about two things:

* Finding and building a knowledge of as many transformations as possible
* Practicing the transformations, so you become fluent in them

### So, how do you get started

Collect a list of 50 transformations for your domain. You don't need to do it in one day, but aim for a significant number. Over time you can add as you encounter them.

Practice one or more transformations on a few ideas that you have collected.

Remember, it's an exploration and practice - most of the new ideas you come up with are going to be terrible and that's fine.

## Understanding impact

* Third skill: recognizing what resonates with you, other people and the world.

This is about learning how to recognize that the art is having an impact on people, how it impacts them and how it changes them. It's mostly about learning your own emotions and how different "collected ideas" change those emotions.

One way to learn it is to try and express a specific emotion and doing it as strongly as possible; using an emotion wheel as a list. Second is trying to understand how different things resonate with you; for example using Mirror of Self test.

Without this skill the result can be beautiful and novel; however without clear feeling and impact. At this moment AI art seems to be lacking this part, but it's pretty good with the first and second skills.

**TODO** Science vs art. Impact dimensions, e.g. mechanical or psychological.

## Freedom in experimentation

* Fourth skill: freedom to be bad and wrong.

This is less about learning a new skill and more about unlearning "need to be right" mentality. Criticising yourself while coming up with ideas seems to stop the flow of ideas. Many good ideas are a result of combining/transforming multiple bad ideas. If you stop the bad ideas from forming, then they can never grow up to be good ideas.

**TODO** rather than no, embrace "yes and".

**TODO** stress.

## Polishing an idea

**TODO** is this a fundamental skill?

Eliminate unnecessary.


## What if missing

If you haven't collected ideas, then you won't have vocabulary to say much... if you haven't learned transforming ideas, then you end up repeating what others have said.


## Conclusion

There could be a few more skills that I've yet to identify, but these do seem a necessity for fluently coming up with new ideas. These skills need to be practiced to the point where you don't need to think about them consciously.
