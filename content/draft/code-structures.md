Code is mainly organized using the following language constructs:

*   folders and files;
*   modules, units or packages;
*   types, classes, nested classes and objects;
*   interfaces, traits, contexts, roles and aspects;
*   methods, functions, nested functions and scopes.

However, there are other ways to describe structures:

*   spatial placement of code structures;
*   similar naming (for example [Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) or [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern));
*   regions ([such as in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-region));
*   comments, documentation and diagrams.

They all have their own pros and cons. The list is useful to find other ways of describing the relations when the common ways cannot be used (for whatever reason).
